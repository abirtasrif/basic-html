  <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1997: Kent Beck introduces user stories at the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit</li>
      <li>1998: Alistair Cockburn visited the C3 project and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."</li>
      <li>1999: Kent Beck published the first edition of the book Extreme Programming Explained, introducing Extreme Programming (XP), and the usage of user stories in the planning game.</li>
       <li>2001: Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation:
   <ul><li> The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible physical token to hold the concepts;</li>
   <li> The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation;</li>
    <li>The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation have been reached.</li></ul></li>
<li>2001: The XP team at Connextra in London devised the user story format and shared examples with others.</li>
      
<li>2004: Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user stories beyond the usage of cards in his book User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Developmentthat is now considered the standard reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler. Cohn names Rachel Davies as the inventor of user stories.[citation needed] While Davies was a team member at Connextra she credits the team as a whole with the invention.</li>
     <li> 2014: After a first article in 2005 and a blog post in 2008, in 2014 Jeff Patton published the user-story mapping technique, which intends to improve with a systematic approach the identification of user stories and to structure the stories to give better visibility to their interdependence.</li>
  </ul>
